# Agricast - Agricultural Weather Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview

Agricast is a comprehensive agricultural weather intelligence platform designed to provide Canadian farmers with real-time weather data, calculated agricultural metrics, and actionable insights for farming operations. The platform integrates multiple data sources including Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) weather stations and NASA POWER satellite data, while building a community-driven ecosystem where farmers contribute local observations and earn rewards through gamification.

## Vision
