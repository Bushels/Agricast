# Agricast - Agricultural Weather Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview

Agricast is a comprehensive agricultural weather intelligence platform designed to provide Canadian farmers with real-time weather data, calculated agricultural metrics, and actionable insights for farming operations. The platform integrates multiple data sources including Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) weather stations and NASA POWER satellite data, while building a community-driven ecosystem where farmers contribute local observations and earn rewards through gamification.

## Vision

To create a farmer-first platform that combines hyperlocal weather intelligence with community insights, helping Canadian farmers make data-driven decisions while building the most accurate agricultural weather network through crowdsourced observations.

## Testing - Status, Challenges & Lessons Learned

### Current Status
- **Unit Tests (Jest)**: 
    - `authService.js`: All PASSING. Verifies user registration, profile creation, username conflict handling, and alpha/beta tester logic using mocks.
    - `cropService.js`: All PASSING. Verifies crop data updates, archival of previous year's data, and crop history retrieval using mocks.
- **Utility Function Tests (Node.js)**:
    - `quickTest.js` (for `findNearestWeatherStation` utility): PASSED.
    - `testRegistrationFlow.js` (for DLS conversion, username validation utilities): Runs successfully, demonstrating core utility functionality. *Note: Its test for `generateUniqueUsername` uniqueness had limitations due to mock scope when run as a plain Node script.*
- **Service-Level Manual Test (Node.js)**:
    - `manual-test.js` (for `getWeatherWithInsights` service): Successfully executed, verifying core weather and precipitation data processing logic.

### Challenges & Blockers
- **Firebase Emulator Port Conflicts**: We are consistently unable to start the Firebase Emulators (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Hub, UI) in the current cloud development environment. Errors indicate "port taken" or "port not open," even when trying alternative port configurations. This is the primary blocker for:
    - Full **Integration Tests** (e.g., `functions/test/integration/stage1.test.js` which relies on HTTP calls to emulated functions).
    - **Local test scripts requiring live emulators** (e.g., `functions/test-local/testAuth.js` which needs live Firestore/Auth for end-to-end service testing).
- This issue is presumed to be an environmental constraint of the cloud IDE related to network port allocation or containerization rather than a code issue within the project itself.

### Lessons Learned (Jest Mocking `firebase-admin`)
- **`FieldValue.serverTimestamp`**: When mocking `admin.firestore`, ensure the mock function also has `FieldValue` as a static property: `const firestoreMock = jest.fn(() => instance); firestoreMock.FieldValue = { serverTimestamp: jest.fn() };`.
- **Transaction Methods (`transaction.get`, `.update`, `.set`)**: For testing services that use Firestore transactions (`db.runTransaction(async (transaction) => { ... })`):
    1. Define your `jest.fn()` mocks for `get`, `update`, `set` in a scope accessible to both the `jest.mock` factory and your tests (e.g., at the top of your test file).
    2. Inside the `jest.mock('firebase-admin', ...)` factory, create a `mockTransactionInstance` object: `{ get: yourGetMock, update: yourUpdateMock, set: yourSetMock }`.
    3. Ensure your mock for `admin.firestore().runTransaction` is an async function that calls its callback argument with this `mockTransactionInstance`: `runTransaction: jest.fn(async (callback) => callback(mockTransactionInstance))`.
    4. In your tests, you can then configure (`mockResolvedValue`, etc.) and assert (`toHaveBeenCalledTimes`, etc.) directly on `yourGetMock`, `yourUpdateMock`, `yourSetMock`.
- **Specific Document Path Mocks**: When a test depends on a specific document existing or not (e.g., `db.collection('usernames').doc('someuser').get()`), ensure your `get` mock is configured for that specific call, often using `mockFn.mockResolvedValueOnce({...})` within the test setup if the mock is generic, or by setting up chained mocks like `admin.firestore().collection('usernames').doc('someuser').get.mockResolvedValueOnce({...})` if your main `admin.firestore().collection().doc()` returns a mock that has its own `get` as a `jest.fn()`.
- **`jest.clearAllMocks()` vs. Specific Mock Resets**: `jest.clearAllMocks()` resets all mocks to their basic `jest.fn()` state. If a mock needs to retain a default implementation (e.g., `mockResolvedValue(false)`) across tests but be overridden for specific tests with `.mockResolvedValueOnce()`, re-establish the default in `beforeEach` after `clearAllMocks` or be very specific with one-time mock implementations.
- **Node.js Scripts vs. Jest Runner**: Scripts intended to be run directly with `node some-test-script.js` cannot use Jest's global objects like `jest.fn()`. Any mocking in such scripts must be done with plain JavaScript techniques (e.g., reassigning functions, simple object mocks).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing Focus
1.  **Attempt Minimal Emulator Startup**: Try `firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore,auth --project demo-agricast` (using the `firebase.json` with the `predeploy` hook commented out). This might reduce port conflicts and allow focused emulator-dependent testing if successful.
2.  **If Emulators Remain Blocked**:
    *   Prioritize creating the `test-agricast-auth.html` page as outlined by Claude. This will allow manual end-to-end testing of the authentication and profile creation flow by deploying to a live (test) Firebase project.
    *   Continue with unit/logic testing for any new backend services developed.

### Development
1.  **Gamification Backend**: Begin design and implementation of the backend logic for gamification features (point calculation, badge awarding, streak tracking).
2.  **Frontend Prototyping**: If resources allow, start basic frontend components for registration and dashboard based on Claude's UI/UX guide, focusing on API integration points.
3.  **Review `generateUniqueUsername` Mocking**: Address the minor mock scope issue in `testRegistrationFlow.js` if it impacts further local utility testing, possibly by refactoring `generateUniqueUsername` to allow Firestore instance injection for easier testing or using module-level mocks for that script.

### Longer Term
- Implement a comprehensive **Test Strategy Document** as recommended, outlining approaches for different environments (mock, emulators, live test project) and conditions.
- Explore environment-aware testing scripts/configurations.
